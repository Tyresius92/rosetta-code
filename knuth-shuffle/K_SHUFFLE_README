The Knuth shuffle (a.k.a. the Fisher-Yates shuffle) is an algorithm 
for randomly shuffling the elements of an array.

########
# Task #
########

Implement the Knuth shuffle for an integer array (or, if possible, an 
array of any type).

# Specification #
#################

Given an array items with indices ranging from 0 to last, the algorithm can 
be defined as follows (pseudo-code):

for i from last downto 1 do:
    let j = random integer in range 0 <= j <= i
    swap items[i] with items[j]

# Notes #
#########

It modifies the input array in-place. If that is unreasonable in your 
programming language, you may amend the algorithm to return the shuffled 
items as a new array instead.

The algorithm can also be amended to iterate from left to right, if that is more convenient.
