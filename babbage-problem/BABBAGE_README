The Babbage Problem: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Babbage_problem

##############
# Background #
##############

Charles Babbage, looking ahead to the sorts of problems his Analytical Engine 
would be able to solve, gave this example:

What is the smallest positive integer whose square ends in the digits 269,696?
— Babbage, letter to Lord Bowden, 1837; see Hollingdale and Tootill, 
        Electronic Computers, second edition, 1970, p. 125.

He thought the answer might be 99,736, whose square is 9,947,269,696; 
but he couldn't be certain.

# Task #
########

The task is to find out if Babbage had the right answer — and to do so, 
as far as your language allows it, in code that Babbage himself would have 
been able to read and understand.

For these purposes, Charles Babbage may be taken to be an intelligent person, 
familiar with mathematics and with the idea of a computer, who has never 
programmed—in fact, who has never so much as seen a single line of code.

The aim of the task is to write a program that is sufficiently clear and 
well-documented for such a person to be able to read it and be confident 
that it does indeed solve the specified problem.
